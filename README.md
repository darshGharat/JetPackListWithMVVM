### What is this repository for? ###

* Here I have covered the how viewmodels are managed in compose.
* Viewmodels that are linked to every screen.
* For achieving this, NavBackStackEntry is used as a lifecycle owner.
* Composable functions that are used to define screens have viewmodel scoped to them.
* ViewModel will remain in memory till the screen is visible.
* Along with that, added Scaffold, TopAppBar in Compose. This follows the material design layout structure in an android app.
* setup navigation framework using Jetpack Compose Composable Functions.


### How do I get set up? ###
